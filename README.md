## Welcome to the Weather App!

This is a simple weather application that allows you to search for the weather in a specific city.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, you will need to do the following:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
Start the development server by running `npm start`.

## Using the App

To use the app, simply enter the name of a city in the input field and press enter. The app will then display the current weather for that city.

## Styling

The component includes basic styling for the input field and label using Tailwind. The input field has a bottom border that changes color when it is focused, and the label appears above the input field when it is focused. You can override these styles by providing your own Tailwind classes.
